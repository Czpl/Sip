# 💧 Sip – A Simple macOS Status Bar App to Remind You to Drink Water

**Sip** is a lightweight macOS status bar app I built for myself to stay hydrated during the day. It runs quietly in the background and sends me reminders to drink water at customizable intervals.

- 🔔 Native macOS notifications
- 🍏 Minimal interface – lives in the status bar

## 📦 Installation

Todo

```bash
git clone
open Sip.xcodeproj
